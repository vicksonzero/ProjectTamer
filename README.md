#ProjectTamer

Augmented Reality monster battle game

#How to play

##Download
1. Go to [ProjectTamer/Build/][2]
2. download the latest version
3. Install to your Android Phone (tested to run on Android 4.4.4 KitKat)
4. Allow unknown sources if you cannot install the app (and you trust me)

## Connect
1. The game auto connects both players
2. One player starts the game first and be the room master.
3. The other player joins a bit later. This can avoid both devices opening a new room together

## Choose monsters
1. Players choose two monsters to battle each other (right now only the first monster is used)
2. The client press Ready, and the host press Start to start the battle

## Game controls
3. Press anywhere of the screen to move your monster, press the three buttons to the right to use skills
4. (Planned) press the switch button to the left to switch monsters
